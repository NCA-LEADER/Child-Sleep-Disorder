# Child-Sleep-Disorder
Poor Baby
My poor grandchild Stayc Brlw has been pressured into not speeping right.
Kaidn Hdsn has said she thght to him your nt sleeping thru taking my geandads job ( Mine) which is true.
I offered his ( Kaidn's) father a job Krt Hdsn a long tome a go, i gave him the work sheet, digital format, and now it has been passed on to Kaidn.
That worksheet isnt Kaidns ligitimatlly.
Thats what my granddaughter said to him.
kaidn admitted she cant think thoughts to him.
If she could ( Never) shes doing nothing wrong.
None criminally responsible age group lso, 10 year olds are responsible for crimes not 3 year olds.
kaidn admits being the results of her sleeping disorder ( transmitting infromation) hes wronged us again without any reason.
